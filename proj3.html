<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<p>Overall objective: solidify your understanding of concurrent programming using mutex locks, semaphores, condition variables,
and the monitor approach.


<p>
Specific objectives:
<ul>
<li>Practice writing your own testing code that generates highly concurrent,
randomized tests, and increases the probability of uncovering race conditions
and other concurrency-related bugs. The code provided for you in assignment 2
provides many hints on how to approach this!
<li>Learn how to generate output that makes it easy to spot race conditions,
deadlocks and starvation by simple observation of output. The code provided
for you in assignment 2 provides many hints on how to approach this!
<li>Develope a solution to the concurrent Gaming Parlor problem, which is a
prototype pattern for generic concurrent resource managers in OS kernels.
<li>Practice writing concurrent code using the monitor approach with condition
variables.
</ul>
