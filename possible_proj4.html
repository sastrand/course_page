<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<p>
Overall objective: Learn how to repurpose the prototype resource manager you
developed in your solution to the Gaming Parlor problem, and use it as a
framework for implementing three OS kernel resource managers that can
handle concurrent invocations. 

<p>
Specific objectives:
<ul>
<li>Learn how to implement a thread manager, or thread pool, that pre-allocates
a number of threads, then allows its clients to make concurrent requests
to allocate and free threads, from/to the pool, so that threads are recycled
rather than destroyed and reallocated from scratch.
<li>Implement a process manager that can dynamically create and destroy
process table entries, and function correctly when invoked concurrently.
<li>Implement a memory manager, or frame manager, that can dynamically
allocate sets of physical memory pages (page frames) to requesting processes.
Again, this manager must function correctly in the presence of concurrent
requests and returns.
<li>Further your understanding of monitor semantics, specifically the
difference between Mesa and Hoare semantics for condition variables.
<li>Learn how to implement condition variables that exhibit Hoare semantics
as opposed to the Mesa semantics that are provided for you in Blitz.
</ul>
