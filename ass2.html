<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<p>
Overall objective: help you understand how to <i>implement</i> and <i>use</i>
a basic form of synchronization primitive: the blocking mutual exclusion lock, commonly referred to as a mutex.
<p>
Specific objectives:
<ul>
<li>Learn how to prevent race conditions in a uniprocessor OS kernel by disabling interrupts.
<li>Learn how to implement the lock and unlock methods of a mutex on a uniprocessor.
<li>Learn how to use a mutex in a concurrent program in order to prevent race conditions (note: this is different to specific objective 1!).
<li>Learn how to test and debug a concurrent program.
<li>Learn how to recognize and fix race conditions, deadlocks and starvation in concurrent programs.
<li>Learn how to use and <i>implement</i> semaphores in a uniprocessor OS kernel. 
<li>Learn how to use mutex locks in combination with semaphores to solve the producer-consumer concurrent programming problem.
<li>Learn how to use and <i>implement</i> monitors and condition variables (with MESA semantics) in a uniprocessor OS kernel. 
<li>Learn how to solve the dining philosopher's concurrent programming problem using mutex locks and condition variables.
<li>Understand the difference between semaphores and condition variables, both in their usage semantics and their underlying implementation.
</ul>
