<h1>Operating System Foundations</h1>
<h2>Course Project Introduction</h2>

<p>
The course project consists of five incremental programming assignments,
based on the
<a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/Blitz/index.html">
BLITZ
</a>
system.
BLITZ consists of software to emulated a CPU and some simple devices,
together with its own assembler, linker, loader, and high
level programming language, called KPL. KPL has been used to write
a complete operating system for BLITZ. Some components of this operating
system will be given to you in the course programming assignments, but
certain key components will be missing, and you will have to write the
code to implement them. In this way, you will incrementally consruct
your own operating system kernel, starting with basic synchronization
primitives, then using them to construct various resource managers within
your kernel that can be invoked concurrently. Eventually, you will implement
system calls to invoke these resource managers from user-level programs.
<p>
The emulated CPU and devices are representative of real-world systems, but
without some of the low-level complexity that complicates the process of
learning about the key underlying concepts. By using BLITZ, students are
able to study, in detail, the low-level operating system code that interacts
with the hardware, as well as design, code and test their own modifications
to the operating system.
