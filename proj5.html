<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<p>
Overall objective: Learn how to implement system calls so that the concurrent
resource managers you implemented in assignment 4 can be accessed from user
code.
<p>
Specific objectives:
<ul>
<li>Understand the difference between system call invocation mechanisms and 
procedure call invocation mechanisms.
<li>Implement a variety of system calls and understand how to pass parameters
and return results.
<li>Implement the fork system call to create a new user-level process as a
clone of the calling process. This will require creating a new thread,
process table entry and page table, and allocating memory pages, using
the various resource managers you built in assignment 4.
<li>Fork a new user-level process and use the exec system call to cause it
to execute a user program, specifically "Hello World".
<li>Understand the difference between writing a user-level "Hello World"
program, and writing all of the underlying OS components that allow it
to be executed.
</ul>
